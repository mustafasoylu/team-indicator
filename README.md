# Team Indicator

A Slack App that shows the status of the users you channel you select. Also, set a pre-defined status for easy handling of your and your teammates status. This application is created using Next.js and Next-auth by Typescript. I currently host this app on Digitalocean using Git pipeline.

Next feature: Set an alarm for yourself to remember when lunch break ends or when you want to take a break from working.
